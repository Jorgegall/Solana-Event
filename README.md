Decentralized Event Management System on Solana Blockchain
Project Overview

This project aims to develop a decentralized event management system built on the Solana blockchain. This platform will empower users to create events, collaborate in their organization, sell tickets, and distribute the generated profits upon event completion.

Core Functionalities

Collaborative Event Organization: Events will rely on user collaboration to materialize, as the necessary funds will be sourced from the sale of Event Tokens purchased by users as collaborators.

Event Token Mechanism: These collaborative event tokens will hold a 1:1 value to a specific currency assigned upon event creation, serving as the Accepted Currency for all transactions. Proceeds from Event Token sales will be deposited into a Treasury Vault. Event organizers can withdraw funds from the Treasury Vault to cover event-related expenses.

Ticket Sales and Profit Distribution: Each event will offer a set number of tickets with a price defined at event creation. Revenue generated from ticket sales will be deposited into a Profit Vault. Upon event completion, each collaborator can withdraw their respective share from the Profit Vault, calculated proportionally to the number of Event Tokens acquired by each collaborator.

Event Structure

The event structure will be defined by the event's basic data and the accounts required for transactions:

Event

Data:

name: String
ticket_price: u64
active: bool
Accounts:

authority: Pubkey
accepted_mint: Pubkey
Program Description

The event manager consists of six (6) primary instructions that outline the system's workflow:

create_event: Creates a new event on the blockchain.

buy_tokens: Transfers the Event Token price value to the Treasury Vault and mints Event Tokens to the collaborator's account.

buy_tickets: Transfers the event ticket price value to the Profit Vault.

withdraw_funds: Transfers funds from the Treasury Vault to the event organizer's account.

close_event: Updates event data to indicate it is no longer active.

withdraw_earnings: Transfers funds from the Profit Vault to the requesting collaborator's account.

Benefits of Decentralized Event Management

Transparency and Accountability: Blockchain technology ensures transparent tracking of funds and transactions, fostering trust among event organizers,collaborators, and participants.

Decentralized Governance: Event rules and parameters can be collectively governed by event stakeholders, promoting a more democratic and inclusive decision-making process.

Reduced Costs and Increased Efficiency: By eliminating intermediaries and streamlining processes, the decentralized approach can lower transaction costs and enhance overall efficiency.

Conclusion

This decentralized event management system on the Solana blockchain offers a innovative and empowering solution for event organization and participation. By leveraging blockchain technology, it promotes transparency, accountability, decentralized governance, and cost-effectiveness, revolutionizing the way events are organized and managed.
